  If   you      have     multiple     spaces    between     words,     you
  are    expected   to    keep    them,   except      where   there's    a
  line   break.    Across   a    line   break,    you   discard   all   the
  spaces  (  since   the   line   break   is   already   doing    the   job
  of    separating   the    words   ).
